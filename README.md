# Homelab

This will eventually have more in it.  I'm just starting to build a homelab using K3s.
I was inspired by [Mischa van den Burg](https://github.com/mischavandenburg).

## Cluster Provisioning

I an running Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS and K3s.

## Hardware

I only have one cluster and since I am just starting to build my homelab it has one node.
I'm using a discarded Dell Inspiron 5000 8GB/1TB SSD. As I find more unused hardware, I'll
add some worker nodes.
